# Monte Carlo Simulation Tool

A modern Java GUI application for visualizing the convergence of Monte Carlo simulations.

## Overview

This application estimates the probability \( P(X < 0.5) \) using uniformly distributed samples in [0,1). It features real-time plotting, responsive controls, and professional UI styling using Java Swing.

## Core Functionality

- Objective: Estimate (𝑋<0.5)P(X<0.5) by simulating a large number of samples.
- Visualization: Displays a real-time line chart showing convergence to the true probability value (0.5)
